AngularJS - AngularJS 1.x - File based script src='files'

From Angular 2.0 - module based

Angular - Client Side Javascript opinionated Framework

Angular MV*/ MVW Framework

MVC - Controller is first class citizen - Client Server Arch
	
controller pushes the model's data to the view
controller handling event associated with controls which are there on the view

View is as dumb as possible

MVP - Thick Client

MVPM - Model View Presentation Model

MVVM - Model View ViewsModel

Two way data binding
jQuery, React.js - Javascript Libraries

library - Your code makes use of functionalities given by library
framework - framework makes use of your code

Why Angular?
client server 
all the time full page request
whole html chunk getting downloaded from server to client
and that too for millions and billions of clients

at the max better solution
make asynchronous calls / partial page request


code is not really modular / reusable
object oriented programming


two main reasons
whole html chunk getting downloaded from server to client
mostly thinking is at page level and hence end up with redundant code


you get only necessary data from the server with asynchronous calls
and do the rendering of html at client side - jQuery template

write code using object oriented way - ES2015+ way onwards

If someone else will take care of above 2 things for you
you can concentrate only on business logic

- so that someone else is nothing but
client side javascript framework
e.g. Angular, Ember

SPA - Single Page Application



Module Formats

Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) - client server
define - export
import - You need to have one module loader called RequireJS

CommonJS - Server side - node
export - module.exports
import - CommonJS function called as require()

Universal Module Definition(UMD) - Both AMD and CommonJS

System.register - by one module loader called as SystemJS
you being programmer you need to tell SystemJS where to look for the file

ES2015 module format
	module bundler - browserify - CommonJS
							webpack - AMD, CommonJS, ES2015 modules

Webpack treats everything as a module.
css,html,js,fonts, images - module
respective loaders
	htmlloader - .html
	cssloader, styleloader - .css


globally install angular cli

npm i -g @angular/cli

list globally installed packages
npm ls - g

go to specific folder

ng new shopping_cart_app





GreetComponent

greetMsg:string;

render greetMsg in view

AWD - Adaptive Web Design - Layout decision is at server side

RWD - Responsive Web Design - Layout decision is at client side


Bootstrap - you can easily achieve Responsiveness to your webpage

CSS3 - media query

Directive
Pipe

	[] = Property Binding
	* = Structural Directive - *ngfor, *ngIf, *ngSwitch
	() = Event Binding
	[()] = Two way Data Binding
	# = template reference variable


User.ts
class User
	Id:number
	name:string
	city:string

component
	users:User[]

render that collection with User name and city
	First
	Last
	Even
	Odd
and even display index


*ngSwitch


Directives - Built-In

Components - directives used with templates. This type of directive
is most common directive type.

Structural Directives - *ngIf, *ngSwitch,m *ngFor

Attribute Directives - Change the appearance or behaviour of an element, component, another directive

NgClass - Adds and removes a set of CSS classes
NgStyle - Adds and removes a set of HTML Styles
NgModel - Add two-way data binding to an HTML Form elements
